# ü§ñ Intelligent Log Analyzer Agent ü§ñ

Welcome to the **Intelligent Log Analyzer Agent**! This dummy version of the project demonstrates an AI-driven log analysis agent that processes, summarizes, and reports on log entries. Its purpose is to assist developers and system administrators in quickly identifying failures and extracting actionable insights from a collection of logs. The agent leverages state-of-the-art language models and structured graph processing to generate failure summaries and detailed reports, making it highly applicable in real-world monitoring, debugging, and system performance analysis.

## üßë‚Äçüíª How to Utilize the Agent

1. **Add Log Entries:**  
   Use the sidebar form to input details like Log ID, Question, Answer, and optional grading information.  
   Submit the form to add your log entry to the session.

2. **Execute the Agent:**  
   Click the **Execute Agent** button to process the logs.  
   The agent will run its graph-based workflow to generate two key outputs:
   - **Failure Analysis Summary:** Provides a concise overview of critical failure logs.
   - **Question Summarization Report:** Delivers insightful analysis that highlights key issues in your logs.

3. **View the Results:**  
   The output is streamed directly on the web interface, and you can expand sections to view detailed cleaned logs and processed data.
